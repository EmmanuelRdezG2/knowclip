00:07.750 --> 00:12.470
Chilling and eating bamboo 
grass is the best thing ever.

00:12.870 --> 00:13.790
Hey now.

00:14.530 --> 00:17.800
Look at you, being so lazy 
so early in the day.

00:18.330 --> 00:19.810
You're in the way of my cleaning.

00:19.810 --> 00:21.000
Scoot.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.340
Okay.

00:24.820 --> 00:27.000
Seconds please, Mom.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.210
Exactly what do you have 
planned for your future?

00:33.240 --> 00:34.430
Jeez...

00:34.890 --> 00:36.350
Could we not talk about my future

00:36.350 --> 00:38.730
when I'm relaxing?

00:38.870 --> 00:40.600
If you have so much time to relax,

00:40.600 --> 00:42.460
you could go look for a part-time job.

00:45.120 --> 00:49.180
I'm too busy relaxing, 
so I'll do it later.

00:52.530 --> 00:55.210
Don't try to suck me up!

00:56.900 --> 00:57.670
Jeez...

00:59.150 --> 01:02.320
I wonder why Mom can't understand

01:02.320 --> 01:04.630
how much time relaxing takes up.

01:13.430 --> 01:13.430
Part Time Jobs!!

01:13.430 --> 01:15.300
WORK KING

01:15.300 --> 01:17.190
Excuse me,

01:17.190 --> 01:19.670
which of these will have jobs

01:19.670 --> 01:21.800
where I can get paid to do nothing?

01:23.440 --> 01:24.760
I don't think there is one.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.430
Really?
